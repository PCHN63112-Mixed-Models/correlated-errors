    "... However, it is a little unsatisfying to have a method that only works *asymptotically* and does not take the true structure of the data into account. Althoughy this may be fine for your use-case, it would be better to have an approach that works *irrespective* of the sample size and is able to flexibly accommodate the actual structure of the data. This is the domain of *linear mixed-effects* (LME) models.\n",

    "... In addition, it is important to recognise that there are many instances where a GLS model is able to achieve everything that an LME model can achieve in a much easier fashion. However, there are many aspects to real-world data that the GLS framework is unable to accommodate. These include:\n",

    "So notice that this now agrees *precisely* with the paired $t$-test. This is true even in a small sample and without the need to appeal to asymptotic statistics. Like GLS, this has been achieved without the need to messily include the subjects as an effect in the model, but is still able to take the subjects as indicative of the structure of the data as well as accommodate the correlation. So, this appears to fix all our problems. The main issue going forward is actually *understanding* what the model is doing. Unfortunately, this is a harderer task than with GLS and will be the focus of the next few lessons on this unit."
