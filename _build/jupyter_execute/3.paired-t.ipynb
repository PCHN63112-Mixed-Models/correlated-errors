    "# The Paired *t*-test\n",
    "To begin our journey into the world of models for repeated measurements, we will start with the simplest possible example: the paired $t$-test. Last semester, we saw how the humble $t$-test can be subsumed into the linear model framework through the use of *dummy variables*. This same approach can be used with paired data[^paired-foot] because the difference between the *independent* and *paired* $t$-test does not lie with the *mean function*. We spent a lot of time last semester discussing different mean functions and, you will be glad to know, this all follows-over into the world of repeated measurements. The difference lies with the *variance function*. Specifically, how we can alter the variance function to accommodate non-zero correlation between the repeats? As we will see in this part of the lesson, there are *two* equivalent ways of doing this with paired data. One of them *side-steps* the issues of dependence whereas the other does not. However, it is useful to understand how both of these work because it provides some crucial insight into modelling repeated measurements that we will generalise as our models get more complex.     "

    "## Two-sample vs Paired *t*-tests\n",
    "To begin with, it is useful to examine *how* the results differ between a *two-sample* and *paired* $t$-test. We can don this in `R` by comparing the results of the `t.test()` function with `paired=FALSE` and `paired=TRUE`. To do this, we use the `mice2` data set from the `datarium` package, that contains the weight of a sample of 10 mice both *before* and *after* some treatment. The experimental question concerns whether the treatment affects the weight of the mice. The data is shown below"

Effectively, a paired $t$-test can be thought of as a *one-sample* $t$-test on the *difference* between the pairs. We will explore this in more detail below, however, it is useful to know that conceptually this is a really key step because it introduces the idea that we can correctly model repeated measurements by *removing* something from the data. If we can make the paired test correct via subtraction, there must be something that is cancelling-out. Whatever this \"something\" is, its removal allows us to treat the *differences* between the pairs as independent.\n",

Effectively, the element that makes repeated measurements difficult has been *removed* via this subtraction. Given that we know that *correlation* is the issue, taking $y_{i\\Delta} = y_{i1} - y_{i2}$ *must* be removing the correlation from the data. This is fairly intuitive because we have reduced correlated pairs of data down to only a single value per-subject. Given that the subjects are taken as independent, the values of $y_{i\\Delta}$ must also be independent. In effect, there are *no* repeated measurements anymore. However, expressing this formally is a useful stepping-stone to more general methods.\n",

    "So, there are two sources to this error. One relates to the fact that the data come from different subjects and the other is just random noise. Rather than a *single* vertical distance from the grand mean ($\\epsilon_{ij}$) we have split this distance into *two* parts: the distance associated with the subject ($S_{i}$) and then anything left over ($\\eta_{ij}$). Of interest is that the *correlation* induced by the repeated measurements can be seen above. Notice how the data from each subject is closely linked. For instance, both measurements for mouse 6 are close together and are both *above* the grand mean. Similarly, both measurements for mouse 8 are close together and are both *below* the grand mean. This implies that each mouse has a unique *constant offset* that moves their measurements above or below the grand mean *as a pair*. The fact that this offset moves the measurements *together* explains why the repeated measurements are *correlated*. In principle, if we remove this offset we remove the correlation. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, let us see what happens if we remove the constant offset given by $S_{i}$. This gives"

Subtracting the $S_{i}$ effectively *removes* the value that shifts each subject's measurements *away* from the mean by some amount that is *unique* to each subject, but *constant* across their own measurements. We can think of this like each person having their own \"bias\" that makes them behave *more* or *less* like the population average. This \"bias\" is what makes that person's repeats correlated, because this is what makes the measurements similar to each other (i.e. both measurements *larger* than average or *smaller* than average). If we *remove* this \"bias\", we *remove* the correlation and the only variance that remains is unrelated to each subject. In the paired $t$-test, this is removed *implicitly* by the subtraction of the pairs."
