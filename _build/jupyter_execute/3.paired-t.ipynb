    "# The Paired *t*-test\n",
    "To begin our journey into the world of models for repeated measurements, we will start with the simplest possible example: the paired $t$-test. Last semester, we saw how the humble $t$-test can be subsumed into the linear model framework through the use of *dummy variables*. This same approach can be used with paired data[^paired-foot] because the difference between the *independent* and *paired* $t$-test does not lie with the *mean function*. We spent a lot of time last semester discussing different mean functions and, you will be glad to know, this all follows-over into the world of repeated measurements. The difference lies with the *variance function*. Specifically, how we can alter the variance function to accommodate non-zero correlation between the repeats? As we will see in this part of the lesson, there are *two* equivalent ways of doing this with paired data. One of them *side-steps* the issues of dependence whereas the other does not. However, it is useful to understand how both of these work because it provides some crucial insight into modelling repeated measurements that we will generalise as our models get more complex.     "

    "## Two-sample vs Paired *t*-tests\n",
    "To begin with, it is useful to examine *how* the results differ between a *two-sample* and *paired* $t$-test. We can don this in `R` by comparing the results of the `t.test()` function with `paired=FALSE` and `paired=TRUE`. To do this, we use the `mice2` data set from the `datarium` package, that contains the weight of a sample of 10 mice both *before* and *after* some treatment. The experimental question concerns whether the treatment affects the weight of the mice. The data is shown below"

Effectively, a paired $t$-test can be thought of as a *one-sample* $t$-test on the *difference* between the pairs. We will explore this in more detail below, however, it is useful to know that conceptually this is a really key step because it introduces the idea that we can correctly model repeated measurements by *removing* something from the data. If we can make the paired test correct via subtraction, there must be something that is cancelling-out. Whatever this \"something\" is, its removal allows us to treat the *differences* between the pairs as independent.\n",

Effectively, the element that makes repeated measurements difficult has been *removed* via this subtraction. Given that we know that *correlation* is the issue, taking $D_{i} = y_{i1} - y_{i2}$ *must* be removing the correlation from the data. This is fairly intuitive because we have reduced correlated pairs of data down to only a single value per-subject. Given that the subjects are taken as independent, the values of $D_{i}$ must also be independent. In effect, there are *no* repeated measurements anymore. However, expressing this formally is a useful stepping-stone to more general methods, particularly when we have more than two repeated measurements.\n",

Of interest is that the *correlation* induced by the repeated measurements can be seen above. Notice how the data from each subject is closely linked. For instance, both measurements for mouse 6 are close together and are both *above* the mean of 0. Similarly, both measurements for mouse 8 are close together and are both *below* the mean of 0. This implies that each mouse has a unique *constant offset* that moves their measurements above or below this line *together*. The fact that this offset moves the measurements *together* explains why the repeated measurements are *correlated*. In principle, if we remove this offset we remove the correlation. So, let us see what happens if we remove the constant offset given by $S_{i}$. We do this be removing the *mean of each subject* from the data. This gives"

In the paired $t$-test, this removal is *implicit* in the subtraction of the pairs and the only error that remains is $\\epsilon_{ij}$. However, we do also have the option of making this removal *explicit* by including the subject constants in the model itself.

    "Notice that a huge amount of the variation in this data was attributable to the variation between different subjects. Now that this has been removed, we can effectively treat our data as *one big sample from a single subject*. As such, the variability we can see between all pairs of measurements provides us with an indication of how *internally consistent* a single subject is across the different conditions of the task. With the overall effect of the conditions removed, this remaining variability is not related to the conditions themseleves. Rather, it is related to other sources of random variation that cause an individual's response to change across multiple repeats of an experiment. This is known as the  *within-subject variance*. \n",

Both the *between-subjects* and *within-subject* variance are effectively sources of *error* because they indicate different ways that the raw data may differ from the means of the conditions. One of these errors comes from the fact that different people may respond consistently higher or lower than the mean. The other comes from the fact that, even if an individual did not respond differently from the mean, natural variation across repeats will always be there.\n",

This is consistent with the idea of the *between-subjects variance* $\\left(\\sigma^{2}_{b}\\right)$ and the *within-subject variance* $\\left(\\sigma^{2}_{w}\\right)$ ...

Furthermore, the degrees of freedom are now correct at $49$. As such, adding the subject effects to the model has allowed the *between-subjects* error to be partitioned out and thus the remaining variance calculated from the residuals is *only* the *within-subject* error. This is the error needed to correctly estimate the standard error of the paired difference and thus the model results are now correct."
