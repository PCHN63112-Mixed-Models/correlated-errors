    "... So what is the correct error here? The obvious, and correct, answer is that it is the *between-subjects* error. So how do we use this in our test statistics? At present, all we have done is *removed* the between-subjects error by including the `Subject` factor in our models. However, we somehow have to use this removed error as the denominator in tests that are based on between-subjects effects."

    "... the difference is that, rather than including the `Subject` factor as something to be estimated and tested (like any other regression coefficients), we instead want to just use these effects for the purpose of estimating the *between-subjects* variance. We already saw from previous examples that the effects of `Subject` are not interesting, as we simply ignored them. Indeed, the $t$-tests and $p$-values and other automatic treatments of these coefficients were both *uninteresting* and *unnecessary*, which is a hint to the fact that we were not really using this factor correctly when adding it to the linear model in this way. This is because `Subject` was, in fact, something known as a *random-effect*.\n",

    "...This distinction between something we want to directly estimate and test and something that is used for calculating varirance is the difference between *fixed-effects* and *random-effects*. As such, in order to use the `Subject` factor in this way, it must be treated as a *random-effect*.\n",
